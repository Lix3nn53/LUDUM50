### GAMEPLAY

There is a comet that is constantly trying to hug our planet because it loves the World so much. Unfortunately that wouldn’t be good for us.

Keep the comet away with rockets. Reach the target year to move on to the next level. You can buy upgrades between levels. Hit the comet to earn money.

Each level the star gets faster, larger and rotates towards the World faster. Also you need to reach a farther year​.
